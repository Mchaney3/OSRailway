[Depronized](http://depronized.com/2018/02/13/presenting-the-os-railway-system-fully-3d-printed-model-train-system/) has already done some amazing work with both the Arduino and 3D printing and design aspect. With such a solid foundation and a way to scratch a childhood itch for cheap, I really couldn't resist. My hope is to continue developing this project for as long as I can. I'm sure the code can be improved on in the BLE version so please lend a hand where you can ;D
